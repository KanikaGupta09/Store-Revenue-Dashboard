# 🏨 Hotel Revenue & Guest Seasonality Analysis

**SQL + Power BI | Revenue Analytics | Business Intelligence**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a **hotel revenue dataset spanning three years (2018–2020)** to uncover patterns in **revenue performance, guest behavior, and seasonal demand**. Using **SQL Server** and **Power BI**, the project builds an end-to-end analytics pipeline—from raw CSV ingestion to interactive dashboards—designed to support **data-driven operational and staffing decisions**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze revenue trends and guest volume across multiple years
* Identify seasonal demand patterns and peak occupancy periods
* Support staffing and operational planning using historical data
* Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for business stakeholders

---

## 🗂️ Data & Scope

* **Time Period:** 2018, 2019, 2020
* **Data Source:** Raw `.csv` hotel revenue dataset
* **Granularity:** Booking-level and date-level records

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **SQL:** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
* **BI & Visualization:** Power BI
* **Data Transformation:** Power Query (M)
* **Data Source:** CSV files

---

## 🔄 End-to-End Data Pipeline

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion

* Imported raw `.csv` files into **SQL Server** using SSMS
* Validated schema, data types, and record completeness

---

### 2️⃣ SQL Data Modeling & Analysis

* Built iterative SQL queries to:

  * Aggregate revenue by date, month, and year
  * Analyze guest volume and booking patterns
  * Identify seasonal revenue and demand fluctuations
* Produced a **final analytical SQL output** optimized for BI consumption

---

### 3️⃣ Power BI Data Transformation

* Imported SQL output into Power BI
* Applied additional transformations using **Power Query (M)**
* Prepared clean, analysis-ready tables for visualization

---

### 4️⃣ Visualization & Dashboarding

* Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard highlighting:

  * Revenue trends across years
  * Guest seasonality and demand spikes
  * Year-over-year performance comparisons
* Enabled stakeholder-friendly filtering and drill-down analysis

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Areas

### Revenue Seasonality

* Identified recurring peak and off-peak revenue periods
* Compared seasonal trends across multiple years

### Guest Trends

* Analyzed guest volume fluctuations by time period
* Linked guest patterns with revenue performance

### Staffing & Operations Insights

* Used demand patterns to propose **staffing recommendations**
* Highlighted periods requiring higher operational capacity

### Dataset Limitations

* Documented assumptions and data constraints
* Addressed potential gaps affecting interpretation

---

## 📈 Business Insights

* Revenue and guest demand exhibit strong seasonal patterns
* Certain periods consistently drive a disproportionate share of annual revenue
* Historical demand trends can be used to **optimize staffing allocation** and reduce operational inefficiencies
